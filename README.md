# RockPaperScissors
Assignment: program a rock, paper, scissors game against the computer in javascript. 
Results can be either in the console log or via pop up windows (prompt/alert).
Play 5 rounds total.

What I learned:
1. FLow of Script: Best practice to write (in order)
    a. Generic variables
    b. Functions
    c. Script that initiates the running of functions
2. Nested ifs: These are hard and can get complicated really quick. Hoping to avoid with more efficient coding
3. Trial/error: Created a separate test script to test single functions at one time. Much easier than trying to run and troubleshoot the entire script at once.
4. console.log: These markers were very useful to help troubleshoot issues with my code. I was able to track where the code was working, not working, bouncing around to and was better able to pinpoint the exact problem.
5. TAKE A BREAK WHEN I FEEL FRUSTRATED. Walking and meditation really helped.

What I would like to do:
1. Use loops to make the script more efficient and less repetetive.
