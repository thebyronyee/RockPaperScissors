# RockPaperScissors
Assignment: program a rock, paper, scissor game against the computer in javascript. 
Results can be either in the console log or via pop up windows (prompt/alert).
Play 5 rounds total.

What I still did not figure out:
1. How to not count a tie as a valid round in the round count. I even tried using "draw" as a variable, but could not make it work.
2. How to manage invalid responses (meaning something that did not spell rock, paper, or scissors)

What I would like to do:
1. Use loops to make the script more efficient and less repetetive.
